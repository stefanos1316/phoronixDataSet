.SH DESCRIPTION
Sometimes simple encryption tools are already in use for a long time
and there might be a desire to integrate them into the GnuPG
framework.  The protocols and encryption methods might be non-standard
or not even properly documented, so that a full-fledged encryption
tool with an interface like \fBgpg\fR is not doable.
\fBsymcryptrun\fR provides a solution: It operates by calling the
external encryption/decryption module and provides a passphrase for a
key using the standard \fBpinentry\fR based mechanism through
\fBgpg-agent\fR.

Note, that \fBsymcryptrun\fR is only available if GnuPG has been
configured with \(aq--enable-symcryptrun\(aq at build time.



For encryption, the plain text must be provided on STDIN or as the
argument \fIinputfile\fR, and the ciphertext will be output to STDOUT.
For decryption vice versa.

\fICLASS\fR describes the calling conventions of the external tool.
Currently it must be given as \(aqconfucius\(aq.  \fIPROGRAM\fR is
the full filename of that external tool.

For the class \(aqconfucius\(aq the option \fB--keyfile\fR is
required; \fIkeyfile\fR is the name of a file containing the secret key,
which may be protected by a passphrase.  For detailed calling
conventions, see the source code.


Note, that \fBgpg-agent\fR must be running before starting
\fBsymcryptrun\fR.


The following additional options may be used:

.TP
.B  -v
.TQ
.B  --verbose
Output additional information while running.

.TP
.B  -q
.TP
.B  --quiet
Try to be as quiet as possible.

.TP
.B  --homedir \fIdir\fR
Set the name of the home directory to \fIdir\fR. If this option is not
used, the home directory defaults to \(oq\fI~/.gnupg\fR\(cq.  It is only
recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any home
directory stated through the environment variable \(oq\fIGNUPGHOME\fR\(cq or
(on Windows systems) by means of the Registry entry
\fIHKCU\\Software\\GNU\\GnuPG:HomeDir\fR.

On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable
application.  In this case only this command line option is
considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

To install GnuPG as a portable application under Windows, create an
empty file named \(oq\fIgpgconf.ctl\fR\(cq in the same directory as the tool
\(oq\fIgpgconf.exe\fR\(cq.  The root of the installation is then that
directory; or, if \(oq\fIgpgconf.exe\fR\(cq has been installed directly below
a directory named \(oq\fIbin\fR\(cq, its parent directory.  You also need to
make sure that the following directories exist and are writable:
\(oq\fIROOT/home\fR\(cq for the GnuPG home and \(oq\fIROOT/home/sgeorgiou/GitHub/phoronixDataSet/tools/gnupg/var/cache/gnupg\fR\(cq
for internal cache files.


.TP
.B  --log-file \fIfile\fR
Append all logging output to \fIfile\fR.  Use \(oq\fIsocket://\fR\(cq to log
to socket.  Default is to write logging information to STDERR.

.P


The possible exit status codes of \fBsymcryptrun\fR are:

.TP
.B  0
        Success.
.TP
.B  1
        Some error occurred.
.TP
.B  2
        No valid passphrase was provided.
.TP
.B  3
        The operation was canceled by the user.

The full documentation for this tool is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
If GnuPG and the info program are properly installed at your site, the
command

should give you access to the complete manual including a menu structure
and an index.
