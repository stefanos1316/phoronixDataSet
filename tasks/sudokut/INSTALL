Sudokut
Version 0.4


1. Installation

The distribution contains several files: you can install it anywhere on
your machine and execute the script from this location. But it is easier to
install the sudokut script file in a directory where it will be
automatically found by the shell (a directory in your PATH environment
variable).

There is a Makefile which makes this task easier on Unix systems (including
Mac OS X): unpack the distribution, change directory to the distribution's
directory and just type:

	make install

This will install sudokut in /usr/local/bin and the manual
page in /usr/local/man/man1. You must have admin permissions to
install there, so you might have to type the following and provide an admin
password:

	sudo make install



2. Documentation

Detailed instructions can be found in the file sudokut.html.

On a Unix system you can also read the man page. If you installed 
it successfully in the previous section, just type:

    man sudokut

from the terminal.
