Sudokut
Version 0.4

Sudokut is a solver of sudoku puzzles. It is a command line tool,
so there is no graphic interface: it is executed as a comand from a
terminal window. Basically, you give it a sudoku string or a sudoku file as
an argument and it returns the solution. If a sudoku does not have a unique
solution, it returns all the possible solutions.

Sudokut is a script that you execute from the shell. It is written
internally in Tcl (the Tool Command Language), so it should work on any
platform (Unix, Mac OS X, Windows) provided a Tcl interpeter is installed
(this is normally the case by default on Unix and Mac OS X). You do not 
have to know anything about the language: just execute the command in a 
terminal window.

Sudokut is fast: it takes approximately 0.2 second to solve a
medium force sudoku; in rare cases, some very difficult ones can take up to
2-3 seconds. It uses an efficient algorithm which guarantees to find all
the solutions.

The sudokut command accepts many options which implement various
features (detailed solving process, validity check, suggestions, probing,
level rating, diff, etc.). The help file coming with the script contains a
complete description of the syntax and lots of examples. You can also 
read the doc online <http://perso.orange.fr/bdesgraupes/DocHTML/sudokut.html>.
