.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
Blogbench is a portable filesystem benchmark that tries to reproduce the load
of a real\-world busy file server.
.br 
It stresses the filesystem with multiple threads performing random reads,
writes and rewrites in order to get a realistic idea of the scalability and the
concurrency a system can handle.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
.TP 
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display a complete list of available switches.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP 
The minimal way to run the test is to just give the path to an \fBempty\fR
and writable directory:
.LP 
blogbench \-d /path/to/the/directory
.LP 
Blogbench will start the required threads and the test will run during 5
minutes. A final "score" will then be given as an indication of read and write
performance.
