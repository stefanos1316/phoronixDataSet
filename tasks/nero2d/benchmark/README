Benchmark Suite
===============

In this directory, you will find 5 wxGBTool geometry files, namely a single PEC, a single dielectric, a 2x2 dielectric array, a 3x3 dielectric array and a 4x4 dielectric array.  All these geometries contain approximately one million unknowns.

You will also find a config.dat script which is contains correct settings for running a benchmark.

You will also find two scripts which can run the parallel benchmarks for 1 to 24 processors.  You will probably want to edit the benchtest script as it is specific for LAM MPI (it contains instructions for setting up a LAM ring, etc.)

The benchmark suite will do the complete setup and do 30 iterations of all these configurations using 1 to 20 processors.  This might take a very long time (in our case: approximately two days).  In order not to disturb the benchmarking all output is suppressed by Nero2d.  Nero2d will write benchmarkXX.dat with XX the number of processes used.  The matlab scripts (also included) can then be used to generate efficienties, etc from these files (plotEfficiency.m, plotSpeed.m, plotSpeedup.m).

Also take into account that these simulations require quite some memory: proceed with caution!

Enjoy your benchmarks!
