1. Open the Renderer-2.x.sln with your Visual Studio
2. Compile in Release mode
3. Right-click on "Renderer-2.x" in the Solution explorer, and select "Properties"
4. Click on "Configuration Properties/Debugging"
5. Enter ..\..\3D-Objects\chessboard.tri inside the "Command Arguments", click OK

You should see a rotating chessboard... 

Read the upper-level README for details on navigation, or hit H (for help).
