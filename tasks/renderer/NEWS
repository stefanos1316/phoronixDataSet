Lots of optimizations, and the code is now as close to perfect
as I will ever get: there is no repetition anywhere, C++ templates
are used to create perfect, type-safe versions of the desired
rasterizer (Gouraud, Phong, shadows, etc). Also, MSVC-specific
project file (solution) was added.

Now supporting meshes saved from shadevis, and interpolating the 
ambient occlusion factor per pixel - much better looking renders.

The package now supports loading of meshes from .3ds files (3D Studio 
files), via lib3ds. To avoid adding lib3ds as an external dependency 
(since it appears to currently be in a state of flux), I added version 
1.3.0 alongside the package sources. It will be auto-built before the
renderer package.
