This directory contains the diffs to gnu time-1.3 that I used for
linux.  Linux (at least with newgcc) doesn't have wait3 so I made
one that performs well enought for time (I hope).
NOTE it isn't really wait3, for example it completly ignors the
options field!!!

To make get the time-1.3 release copy linux.c into the directory and
patch < diffs.
