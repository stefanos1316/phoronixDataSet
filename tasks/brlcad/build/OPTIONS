CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
---------------------

--- BRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS ---

Enables compilation of all 3rd party sources that are provided within a BRL-CAD
source distribution.  If used this option sets all other 3rd party library
build flags to ON by default.  However, that setting can be overridden by
manually setting individual variables. Default is "AUTO" - 3rd party sources
are compiled only if they are not detected as being available and functioning
as expected.

Aliases:  ENABLE_ALL


--- BRLCAD_ENABLE_OPENGL ---

Enable support for OpenGL based Display Managers in BRL-CAD.
Default depends on whether OpenGL is successfully detected -
if it is, default is to enable.

Aliases:  ENABLE_OPENGL


--- BRLCAD_ENABLE_RUNTIME_DEBUG ---

Enables support for application and library debugging facilities.
Disabling the run-time debugging facilities can provide a significant
(10%-30%) performance boost at the expense of extensive error
checking (that in turn help prevent corruption of your data).
Default is "ON", and should only be disabled for read-only render
work where performance is critical.

Aliases:  ENABLE_RUNTIME_DEBUG, ENABLE_RUN_TIME_DEBUG, ENABLE_RUNTIME_DEBUGGING
          ENABLE_RUN_TIME_DEBUGGING


--- BRLCAD_FLAGS_DEBUG ---

Add compiler flags to aid in program debugging.  Defaults to ON.

Aliases:  ENABLE_DEBUG, ENABLE_FLAGS_DEBUG, ENABLE_DEBUG_FLAGS


--- BRLCAD_ENABLE_COMPILER_WARNINGS ---

Use extra compiler warning flags when compiling C/C++ code.  Defaults to ON.

Aliases:  ENABLE_WARNINGS, ENABLE_COMPILER_WARNINGS


--- BRLCAD_ENABLE_STRICT ---

Causes all compilation warnings for C code to be treated as errors.  This is now
the default for BRL-CAD source code, and developers should address issues
discovered by these flags whenever possible rather than disabling strict
mode.

Aliases:  ENABLE_STRICT, ENABLE_STRICT_COMPILE, ENABLE_STRICT_COMPILE_FLAGS


--- ENABLE_ALL_CXX_COMPILE ---

Build all C and C++ files with a C++ compiler.  Defaults to OFF.

EXPERIMENTAL!

Aliases:  ENABLE_ALL_CXX


--- BRLCAD_EXTRADOCS ---

The core option that enables and disables building of BRL-CAD's
DocBook based documentation (includes manuals and man pages for
commands, among other things).  Defaults to ON, but only HTML and MAN
formats are enabled by default - PDF must be enabled separately by use
of this option or one of its aliases.  Note that you may set
environment variable APACHE_FOP to point to your locally installed fop
executable file (which on Linux is usually a shell script with 0755
permissions).

Aliases:  ENABLE_DOCS, ENABLE_EXTRA_DOCS, ENABLE_DOCBOOK
