Benchmark results indicate an approximate VGR performance metric of 24803
Logarithmic VGR metric is 4.39  (natural logarithm is 10.12)
#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#

These numbers seem to indicate that this machine is approximately 24803 times
faster than the reference machine being used for comparison, a VAX 11/780
running 4.3 BSD named VGR.  These results are in fact approximately 4.39
orders of magnitude faster than the reference.

Here are some other approximated VGR results for perspective:
    120 on a 200MHz R5000 running IRIX 6.5
    250 on a 500 MHz Pentium III running RedHat 7.1
    550 on a dual 450 MHz UltraSPARC II running SunOS 5.8
   1000 on a dual 500 MHz G4 PowerPC running Mac OS X 10.2
   1500 on a dual 1.66 GHz Athlon MP 2000+ running RedHat 7.3
  52000 on a 4x4 CPU 2.93 GHz Xeon running RHEL Server 5.4
  65000 on a 512 CPU 400 MHz R12000 Running IRIX 6.5

WARNING: This may not be an optimized compilation of BRL-CAD.
Performance results may not be optimal.

Official benchmark results are optimized builds with all run-time
features enabled and optionally without compile-time debug symbols.

For proper results, run 'make clean' and recompile with the
following configure options added:
  --enable-optimized

Read the benchmark.tr document for more details on the BRL-CAD Benchmark.
The document should be available in the 'doc' directory of any source
